# I'm a ton of different things.

I play **music** which means I play the guitar, the bass, keys, and I think I can hold a beat. I'm also a big **media** fanatic, which means I like to make videos, shoot photos, and talk about everything I don't like. You can consider my hobby to be my [atsprouse.vsco.co][0] grid. The last thing I am is a **marketer**. I'm a senior marketing student at Oral Roberts University. And I'm very good. I lead my team to get "A"'s every time and my marketing professors love me. 

I'm still figuring out life but this website is where you can go to catch up on what new project I'm working on. My Meyers Briggs is _INTP _which mean I'm in a class of only 3% which is my strength and my weakness. I tend to forget about people's feelings when I try to fix a problem. If I've ever yelled at you, don't take it personal. I truly believe that people are the most valuable thing that God gave us and we must treasure them with every moment we have.
